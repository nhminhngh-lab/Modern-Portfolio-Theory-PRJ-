This report presents analytical results and visualizations for a portfolio optimized using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), combined with forward-looking projections generated through Monte Carlo simulation across thousands of future scenarios.

The objective is to apply financial modeling techniques, quantitative tools, and data visualization to examine the risk–return relationship, extract actionable insights from data, and support more informed portfolio strategy decisions, including estimating the potential future value range of assets.
